## Overview

This tap provides both **Homebrew Formulae** and **Casks** for installing the `nanoid` CLI across multiple platforms and architectures.

---

## üç∫ Cask (Preferred)

> A single `nanoid` cask dynamically installs the correct binary for your system (macOS or Linux, Intel or ARM64).

Install via cask:

```bash
brew tap sixafter/tap
brew install --cask nanoid
```

### ‚úÖ Supported Platforms

- **macOS**
  - `arm64` (Apple Silicon)
  - `amd64` (Intel)
- **Linux**
  - `arm64`
  - `amd64`

> üîê **Note for macOS users**: If you see a `killed` error when running `nanoid`, macOS may have quarantined the binary due to it being unsigned or unnotarized. To resolve:
>
> ```bash
> sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /opt/homebrew/bin/nanoid
> ```

---

## üß™ Formula (Deprecated)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The formula is maintained only for compatibility with older workflows. Prefer the `nanoid` cask.

Available formula:

- [**`nanoid` Formula**](Formula/nanoid.rb)

Install via formula:

```bash
brew tap sixafter/tap
brew install nanoid
```
